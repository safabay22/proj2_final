Stroke Prediction Integrating Tabular and CT Data

This project aims to develop a model capable of predicting the risk of stroke in individuals, using diverse data to analyze the contributing factors.

The project was implemented in Google Colab GPUA100  (PYTHON)
Data Sources:
We used two types of data:

1. Tabular Data: Medical information about patients such as : age, hypertension, heart_disease , work_type , Residence_type , avg_glucose_level , bmi.


2. CT Data: Brain scan images for stroke analysis.
